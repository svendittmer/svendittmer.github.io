        Hey guys, I know this website looks a little bit bare-boney right now, but I promise I'll add some CSS later.
        Just wanted to ship this asap!

  <h1 id="first-blog-entry">First Blog entry</h1>
<p>I've been playing with the thought of building my own blog for a few months, and now is the time I turn this thought into reality. Choosing a platform wasn't easy, and I considered using Wordpress, Ghost, Jekyll or Medium until I decided to dive into Middleman instead. I might still copy some articles to Medium though, since I am already registered at Medium and I spend at least a couple minutes every day to check out what's going on there.</p>

<h3 id="why-middleman">Why Middleman?</h3>
<p>Well, first of all I like the idea of creating static websites. Since I'm dealing with database-backed web-apps at work every day, it seemed to me that diving into this kind of technology might broaden my mind and enable me to look at building websites in a new, different way. Secondly, Middleman is based on Ruby, so I can bring in my experience as Ruby on Rails Developer and use my favorite Template Language Slim.</p>

<p>Alright, this should be enough text for a first blog entry. Writing is done, now ship it!</p>
