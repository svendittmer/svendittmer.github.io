    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had quite some trouble deploying my site to github pages.
The reason is that the deploy needs to be configured differently,
depending on whether you create a website for a project or for your account.
The default configuration won't work if you're making a website for an
account. This configuration worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;activate :deploy do |deploy|
  deploy.deploy_method = :git
  deploy.branch = 'master'
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, note that the current version of middleman-deploy (1.0.0) doesn't seem to
do the trick, I had to use the alpha Version: &lt;code&gt;gem "middleman-deploy", "~&amp;gt; 2.0.0.pre.alpha"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out how it works, I must say that I'm quite happy with the result:
The deploy works like a charm and I've got a free website now, ssl already included! ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing with the thought of building my own blog for a few months, and now is the time I turn this thought into reality. Choosing a platform wasn't easy, and I considered using Wordpress, Ghost, Jekyll or Medium until I decided to dive into Middleman instead. I might still copy some articles to Medium though, since I am already registered at Medium and I spend at least a couple minutes every day to check out what's going on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-middleman"&gt;Why Middleman?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all I like the idea of creating static websites. Since I'm dealing with database-backed web-apps at work every day, it seemed to me that diving into this kind of technology might broaden my mind and enable me to look at building websites in a new, different way. Secondly, Middleman is based on Ruby, so I can bring in my experience as Ruby on Rails Developer and use my favorite Template Language Slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, this should be enough text for a first blog entry. Writing is done, now ship it!&lt;/p&gt;
