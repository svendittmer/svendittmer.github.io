Today I'm starting a series of beginner tutorials for budding web developers. I expect the reader to have a basic understanding of the topic. My goal is to provide some best practices that go a little beyond "Hello World". The articles will cover Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some other related stuff. The first article will be about saving records in ActiveRecord, possible gotchas and best practices.
